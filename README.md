# metroazwei
A modern LaTeX Beamer theme for the A2 collaboration

MetroA2 is derived from [Metropolis](https://github.com/matze/mtheme), with changes made to colour, 
a hard-coded A2-Logo in the upper right corner and some slight chances to the design itself.

For a sample take a look: https://github.com/jwettig/metroazwei/blob/master/demo/demo.pdf
